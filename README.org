worch-ups - worch tool/feature support for UPS operations

This package provides worch/waf tools and features which may be used from a [[https://github.com/brettviren/worch][worch]] configuration to add support for producing [[https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/ups][UPS]] "products".



* Development

To set up to develop this package:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  $ virtualenv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate
  $ for repo in worch python-ups-utils worch-ups
  > do
  >   git clone git@github.com:brettviren/$repo.git
  >   cd $repo
  >   python setup.py develop
  >   cd ..
  > done
#+END_EXAMPLE

Not, the version of "waf" that is available in =PATH= after this is probably not going to work.
